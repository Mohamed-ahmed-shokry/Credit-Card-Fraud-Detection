# Architecture

This document describes the boundaries that make the project reproducible and
safe to extend. The project is a reference implementation, not a complete
financial-services platform.

## Runtime flow

1. `data.py` loads CSV input, rejects ambiguous schemas and unsafe values, and
   exposes a `ValidatedDataset` containing numeric features and a binary target.
2. `model.py` performs stratified or temporal splitting, fits the selected
   estimator and calibration policy, chooses a validation-only threshold, and
   evaluates the untouched test split.
3. The fitted `FraudModel` owns feature ordering, probability validation,
   thresholded decisions, local explanations, metadata, and artifact loading.
4. `cli.py` orchestrates offline workflows without duplicating model logic:
   training, comparison, scoring, monitoring, promotion evidence, model-card
   inspection, and compliance rendering.
5. `api.py` adapts the same `FraudModel` to bounded FastAPI requests. Batch and
   single-transaction endpoints share one scoring helper.
6. `drift.py` compares current numeric distributions with the training profile;
   `evaluation.py` computes holdout, calibration, and threshold reports;
   `reporting.py` renders promotion evidence as escaped, self-contained HTML.

## Artifact contract

An artifact directory contains:

```text
manifest.json   SHA-256 digests for model.joblib and metadata.json
metadata.json   JSON model card, schema, metrics, profile, and lineage
model.joblib    trusted-process pickle containing the fitted FraudModel
```

`save_model` writes temporary files and replaces the final files only after the
metadata and manifest are complete. `load_model` verifies the manifest before
deserialization, checks the scikit-learn runtime, validates the embedded model,
and confirms that embedded and readable metadata agree.

The lineage block on newly trained artifacts contains:

- `dataset_fingerprint`: SHA-256-derived fingerprint of feature and target data;
- `config_hash`: SHA-256 of the canonical training configuration;
- `code_version`: package version used by the training process;
- `content_hash`: deterministic hash over dataset, configuration, and code
  version;
- optional `git_commit` and `git_repository` values from CLI training.

Lineage is additive. Artifacts created before lineage was introduced remain
loadable, but their model cards identify the missing provenance.

## Serving boundary

`create_app` receives an already trusted model or resolves one from
`FRAUD_MODEL_PATH` at startup. It applies request-size limits, strict finite
numeric validation, optional API-key and in-memory rate limiting middleware,
request correlation headers, structured logging, and isolated Prometheus
metrics. Authentication, network policy, durable rate limiting, secret
management, and audit-log retention remain deployment responsibilities.

The API does not retrain or mutate a model. Threshold overrides are explicit in
the request and response, while the tuned artifact threshold remains visible as
`model_threshold`.

## Evaluation invariants

- The validation split owns threshold and model-selection decisions.
- The test split is untouched until final evaluation.
- Temporal evaluation sorts by the configured time feature and rejects
  single-class windows.
- Calibration is fit inside training data and is never fitted on holdout data.
- Drift is a diagnostic signal; it is not treated as proof of changed model
  quality without labels and business context.
- Compliance reports assemble evidence and never make an automatic promotion
  decision.

## Extension guidance

New estimators should be added through `EstimatorType` and `_build_base_estimator`
so calibration, splitting, evaluation, artifact validation, and explanations
remain shared. New reports should expose a serializable payload builder in the
relevant domain module and keep rendering/orchestration in `cli.py` or
`reporting.py`. New API fields should be additive where possible and covered by
request-validation and response tests.
